<h2>Adding Objects</h2>

So how does this all this come together for the game we are making? To start with, we will need two objects. Let's first create the very simple wall object, as this object needs no behaviour at all since it will 
not react to any events in the game world.
<br>
<br>

To create the wall object you must follow these steps:

<ol>
	<li>From the drop down <i>Resources</i> menu in the main <i>GameMaker</i> window choose <b>Create Object</b>. The Object Properties form appears, as is shown below:
		<br>
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="6_1.png">
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Click on the <i>Name</i> field and rename the object to "<b>obj_wall</b>".
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Click on the <i>Menu icon</i> at the end of the <i>Sprite</i> field and in the list of available sprites select the "<b>spr_wall</b>" sprite.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Instances of the wall object must be "flagged" as solid, that is, no other instances should be allowed to penetrate them. To this end click on the box next to the <b>Solid</b> property to enable it.
		<br>
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="6_2.png">
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Press OK to close the form.
</ol>

For the clown object we start in the same way:

<ol>
	<li>From the <i>Resources</i> menu, choose <b>Create Object</b>.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Click on the <i>Name</i> field and rename the object to "<b>obj_clown</b>".
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Click on the icon at the end of the Sprite field and select the "<b>spr_clown</b>" sprite.
</ol>

Note that we do not make the clown object solid! Moving instances should <i>never</i> be flagged as solid in their object properties as that can cause some serious issues with collisions, so reserve this option for 
wall objects, platform objects and other things that shouldn't move around the room when added as instances. Now, for the clown there is a lot more that needs to be done as we have to specify its behaviour, which 
we will do on the next page...
