<h2>The Mouse Event</h2>

Finally we need to define what to do when the user clicks with the left mouse button when the cursor is over the clown. We are going to add four actions here...
<br>
<br>

First of the actions that we will add to the event is to add 10 points to the score. This is easy as <i>GameMaker</i> has a built in variable that can automatically keep a score for you. The next action we want to 
play the click sound, and then, after this, we will jump the clown to a random position, setting a new random direction of motion with a slightly increased speed. Finally, the last two actions are added to gradually 
increase the difficulty of the game.
<br>
<br>

The following steps explain how to create the mouse event that we require:

<ol>
	<li>Press the <b>Add Event</b> button. In the <i>Event Selector</i> click on the <b>Mouse Event</b> and in the sub-menu that appears select <b>Left Pressed</b>. This event happens when the user 
	<i>presses</i> the left mouse button while the mouse cursor is on top of the instance and will only be triggered <i>once</i> for each press. Note that, like collisions, a normal mouse event will only be triggered 
	when the cursor is considered to be touching the collision mask of the instance, so if the instance has no sprite assigned, this event will not trigger!
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>From the tab labelled <b>Score</b> include the <i>Set Score</i> action.
		<br>

		<br>	
	<li>As new score indicate a value of 10 and also click on the box next to the property <b>Relative</b> to enable it. When <b>Relative</b> is enabled the value is added to the current score, otherwise the 
	score would be replaced by the value.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>From the tab <b>Main1</b> include a <b>Play Sound</b>action and for the sound indicate "<i>snd_click</i>". Leave Loop as false.
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="8_2.png">
		<br>
	<li>From the <b>Move</b> tab, include a <b>Jump to Random</b> action, which places the instance in a random, collision-free position. The parameters can be left unchanged for this action.
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="9_2.png">
		<br>
	<li>Finally we include a <b>Move Fixed</b> action.
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="7_2.png">
		<br>
	<li>Again select all eight arrows (and not the centre square) and for the speed indicate a value of 0.5 and enable the <b>Relative</b> property to <i>add</i> 0.5 to the current speed. If you don't flag the 
	"relative" box, then the speed will be <i>set</i> to 0.5 (and if you keep relative ticked and use -0.5, the speed will <i>decrease</i> by the given amount).
</ol>

That is all the actions we need for the <b>Mouse Event</b> and the finished event list should look like this:

We are now finished with the clown object. We have included actions for the three events that are important, so press the OK button to close the Object Properties window and get ready to actually see your game come to 
life as we create a room and place some instances into it!
