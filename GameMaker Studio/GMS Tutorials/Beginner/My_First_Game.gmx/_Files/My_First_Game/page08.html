<h2>The Collision Event</h2>

The next event we will define is a <b>Collision Event</b> with the wall object. The collision event is triggered once for every step of the game that two instances are touching, and an instance is considered as 
touching when a part of its <i>collision mask</i> (as defined in the <b>Sprite Properties</b> overlaps that of the other instance in a collision. In this case we want the clown to bounce against the wall, 
changing direction and playing the bounce sound effect at the same time.
<br>
<br>

To do this, follow these steps:

<ol>
	<li>Press the <b>Add Event</b> button. In the <i>Event Selector</i> click on the <b>Collision Event</b> button and select "<b>obj_wall</b>". The collision event between "obj_clown" and "obj_wall" is 
	now added to the list of events.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Include a <b>Bounce</b> action by dragging it from the page at the right (from the "<i>Move</i>" tab, "<i>Jump</i>" section).
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="8_1.png">
		<br>
	<li>Leave the default values for this action. We are not interested in precise bounces and we want to bounce against solid objects (since we flagged the "obj_wall" object as <i>solid</i> in it's object properties).
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Press OK to close the action window.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Select the tab <b>"Main1"</b>, and from it include the <b>Play Sound</b> action in the collision event action list.
		<br>
		<img class="center" src="8_2.png">
		<br>
	<li>Drag the <b>Play Sound</b> action below the <b>Bounce</b> action already present. In the action window, click on the icon to the right of the Sound property which will bring up a list of all available sound 
	assets (from the resource tree), and from the list select "<i>snd_bounce</i>". Leave the <b>Loop</b> property as <tt>false</tt> since we want to play the sound only once, not have it looping constantly.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li>Press OK to close the action.
</ol>

That concludes the collision event with the wall object! It now has two actions to be performed (in the given order) when the collision occurs. If you have made a mistake, you can right-click with the mouse on an 
action you added and, for example, choose <b>Delete</b> to remove the action (or press the &lt;Delete&gt; key on the keyboard). You can also choose <b>Edit Values</b> to change the properties of the 
action (<i>double-clicking</i> on the action will do the same), and you can drag them up and down to change the order in which they are executed within the action list for the event.
