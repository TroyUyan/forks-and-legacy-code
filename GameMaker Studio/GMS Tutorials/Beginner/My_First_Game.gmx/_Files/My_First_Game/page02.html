<h2>The Game Idea</h2>

Before jumping into the action, we should take a moment to plan out our game. It's all too easy to sit down to start working on an idea and then later find that you have lost focus and that the game is not what 
you actually intended it to be! This in turn leads to an abandoned project and a sensation of having wasted your time, which is obviously not something you want to happen. Therefore, we should make a very simple 
<b>design document</b> which outlines all the important things we want in our game. Once the game has been completed following this document, we can go back and revise and change things.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Design Documents</h2>
Design documents can take any form you wish, like a full blown essay with doodles and art clipped onto it, or a simple note with some bullet points. The important thing here is to give your project a definite direction 
and have a list of goals that you want to achieve. Here's our design document for "Catch The Clown":

<h3>Description</h3>
"Catch the Clown" is a little action game. In this game a clown moves around in a playing field. The goal of the player is to catch the clown by clicking with the mouse on him. If the player progresses through the game 
the clown starts moving faster and it becomes more difficult to catch him. For each catch the score is raised and the goal is to get the highest possible score. Expected playing time is just a few minutes.</i>

<h3>Goals/Resources</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Game objects</b> - There will be just two game objects: the clown and the wall. The wall object has a square like image. The wall surrounding the playing area is made out of these objects. The wall object does nothing. 
	It just sits there to stop the clown from moving out of the area. The clown object has the image of a clown face. It moves with a fixed speed. Whenever it hits a wall object it bounces. When the player clicks on the clown with the 
	mouse the score is raised with 10 points. The clown jumps to a random place and the speed is increased with a small amount.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li><b>Sounds</b> - We will use two sounds in this game. A bounce sound that is used when the clown hits a wall, and a click sound that is used when the player manages to click with the mouse on the clown.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li><b>Controls</b> - The only control the player has is the mouse. Clicking with the left mouse button on the clown will catch it.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li><b>Game Play</b> - At the start of the game the score is set to 0. The room with the moving clown is shown. The game immediately begins. When the player presses the <Esc> key the game ends.
		<br>
		<br>
	<li><b>Levels</b> - There is just one level. The difficulty of the game increases because the speed of the clown increases after each successful catch.
</ul>

That should be good enough for the moment, and we can now start creating the game!
