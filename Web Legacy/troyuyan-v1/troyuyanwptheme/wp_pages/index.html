<p>Hi there! I'm Troy Uyan, a web developer, graphic designer, and photographer. I’m currently studying web development programming and I’ve wanted to setup a personal portfolio site for quite some time, and now that I have the skills to do it – I did!</p>
<p>This is a hand-coded showcase of my work with responsive web design, Sass, and Foundation using WordPress as a CMS platform. This site features examples of my <a href="http://troyuyan.com/wp/portfolio/web-development/">web development</a>, <a href="http://troyuyan.com/wp/portfolio/graphic-design/">graphic design</a>, and <a href="http://troyuyan.com/wp/portfolio/photography/">photography</a> work in the <a href="http://troyuyan.com/wp/portfolio/">portfolio section</a>. But it also acts as a home for my <a href="http://troyuyan.com/wp/racing/">racing</a> and <a href="http://troyuyan.com/wp/gaming/">gaming</a> projects, along with other <a href="http://troyuyan.com/wp/experiments/">experiments</a> I’ve taken on along the way.</p>
<p>So enjoy and take a look around! Check out the latest releases in the <a href="http://troyuyan.com/wp/updates/">updates</a> section to see what I’ve been up to recently and feel free to <a href="http://troyuyan.com/wp/contact/">let me know</a> what you think about my site!</p>
<p>- Troy Uyan</p>
