apps page to top-level nav?

prevent directory listings (htacess article in email)

sub navs on portfolio, exper, about all need to be changed to something else because they look awful on small response, make into little stroke-only buttons maybe?

404 and other error pages, has a sitemap

sitemap page? social icon in footer of the dom tree icon as the link?

pictures and headers in portfolio and experiments need to be links as well!!
+ give them a class or something for response with pictures in port and experis.. also about page pic

about page > interests section? or remove from sub-nav

play with a 2-col layout for portfolio and experiments

need something for sub-navs? I.e like a function that outputs how it is now but then a triggers something at a small view port to be a vertical nav so its nicer on responsive.

favicon, header bg with "TU" and U is main blue

remove .php from URLs? htaccess in email or web>learning>apache notes, can also look on the /wp site
