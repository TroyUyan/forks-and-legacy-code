	The racing calculator app is a project to make the redundant auto racing and simulation racing calculations easier and faster! It also provides a basic race strategy based on the race information. This was my first attempt at creating an application people could use and share, lots learned and lots of fun!<br>

	The second scratch-built portfolio site for myself. The site has been revamped with new design techniques and tools as well as database integration to make the content more dynamic. No CMS is used this time around, the framework is self-working with a series of PHP scripts.<br>

	The Sonshine Christian School is an elementary school, preschool, and daycare all rolled into one. They had been paying a couple hundred dollars a month on an education-based CMS, so the solution was to get them onto a WordPress install they could easily edit as end-users.<br>

<p>
	Initially intended to be my portfolio site, the project scope for my beta site expanded rapidly to cover my entire life (competitive racing and gaming, side-projects, etc.) and in the end I disbanded it. But not without creating a completely scratch-built and responsive CMS site a mere four months after I learned basic HTML!<br>

	The Shulnak Village Project is a non-profit organization to bring better education supplies to regions of Tibet and the people who run it are incredibly nice and thoughtful. As a school project we were able to make them a website to display their project information, accept donations, run a blog, and have a mailing list. It was a lot of fun!<br>
