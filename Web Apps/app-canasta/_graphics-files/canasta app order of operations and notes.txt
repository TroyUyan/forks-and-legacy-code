Variables needed
(all cookies so can keep for a week + can swap between PHP and JS)
--------------------------------

gameStarted	// is there a game going, bool
roundCount	// keep track of round of the game

numOfTeams	// 2, 3 or 4

teamOneName
teamTwoName
teamThreeName
teamFourName // string with inserted value for name

teamOneTotalScore // integer to track total numeric pts

teamOneBonusPts // integer to track total numeric pts (bonus only)

teamOnePenaltyPts // integer to track total numeric pts (penalty only)

teamOneRoundWins // integer to track total rounds won

use arrays for all team data instead of vars? ex:
teamOne['name',totalscore,bonuspts,penaltyPts]


??? How to keep track of round by round scores? multi-dem array? Arrays that can be created after each result submit?
could just add to roundScores[roundCount - 1] to give an array of 4 numbers (x,x,0,0 if only 2 teams for example)

roundScores =
[
	[1230,40,540,700], [1230,40,540,700], [1230,40,540,700]
]


??? How to order teams at the winner page or in round-by-round results if pts data is in an array?


???? Round wins, bonus pts, penalty pts all in a big array as well! or at least each has its own array
